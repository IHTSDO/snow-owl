/**
 * Compact representation of the SNOMED&nbsp;CT ontology. Provides a high-performance
 * access to the ontology. Capable to extract semantic meaning by traversing the active concepts and 
 * active relationships and/or execute ESCG queries from its underlying stateful cache.
 * Since the taxonomy uses a cache under the hood its instantiation time and memory consumption is 
 * higher than any other stateless services in general. Clients should reuse one instance than frequently 
 * creating a new one.
 * <p>Clients should be also aware of the following:
 * <p>The taxonomy represents the current/actual state of the SNOMED&nbsp;CT ontology when an instance is created.
 * The taxonomy is not aware of changing its internal state after making any kind of modifications in
 * the ontology, hence the state of the taxonomy may be out of sync from the actual content of
 * the SNOMED&nbsp;CT ontology.
 * <p>Clients should consider acquiring a write lock on the SNOMED&nbsp;CT repository when running any scripts
 * which use a taxonomy instance to ensure data consistency.
